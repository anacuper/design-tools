To get better understanding of Argon for Twine, letâ€™s try an example.

First step is to download story images to show 3D models from [here](https://github.com/argonjs/understanding-argon-twine/blob/master/storybook.pdf).
You can print out the story images or simply have it open on the computer screen.

Now, follow the steps below:
1) Open the Argon4 application on your phone.
2) Navigate to http://philkt.me/understanding-ar-twine/ on the application.
3) With the website open, hold the phone over a story image.
4) 3D model associated with the story image will automatically appear with text descriptions.

Source code is found in this [GitHub directory](https://github.com/argonjs/understanding-argon-twine).
In the next part, we will show you the underlying principles behind this example and how to create your own.
