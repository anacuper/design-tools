title: 'Part 1: Getting Started with Argon for Twine'
---

In order to simplify the process of programming narrative augmented reality experiences, Argon has been integrated with the interactive narrative framework called `Twine`. You can learn about Twine from the [framework's website](http://twinery.org).

You may use Twine online or download the offline version available on the Twine homepage. We strongly recommend using the downloadable version, as the online version of Twine stores projects in your web browser’s cache, which is unreliable. On opening Twine, you should see an empty dashboard, the future home of any AR experiences you create.

When developing with Twine, “formats” are used to interpret your project. There are three standard formats that come included with Twine: Harlowe, Snowman, and SugarCube. Developing AR experiences with Twine requires the OldFashioned format, which is based on SugarCube but adapted to support AR features provided by Argon. To add the OldFashioned format to Twine, click the “Formats” label to the right of the dashboard. Click “Add a New Format”, and copy http://bmaci.com/OldFashioned/format.js into the text field. Click the “Add” button, and you are now ready to create your own AR experiences!
