title: 'Part 1: Getting Started with Argon for Twine'
---

In order to make it easier to program narrative experiences, Argon has been integrated with the interactive narrative framework called `Twine`. You can learn about Twine from the [frameworks website](http://twinery.org)

As noted. Argon for Twine uses a special format called OldFashioned, which you have to add to your Twine app (or the browser if you are using Twine from the browser). To add OldFashioned type `http://bmaci.com/OldFashioned/format.js` into the add format dialogue box in the Twine page.  OldFashioned is based on the Twine format called SugarCube, but is adapted to support AR features provided by Argon.
