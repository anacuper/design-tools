This page should also describe the situation with various browsers and Argon. 

On this page, we provide a brief overview of the design of *argon.js*, introducing some of the terminology and concepts used by the framework. A more detailed overview can be found in the documentation for [argonjs itself]()

The goal of the *argon.js* framework and associated [Argon Browser](http://argonjs.io/argon-app) (currently on iOS) is to use web technologies to create fully-registered 3D Augmented Reality (AR) applications that leverage 3D graphics, geo-spatial-positioning, and computer-vision tracking (currently using the [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com) vision engine). While some of these capabilities are currently available only in the **Argon Browser**, *argon.js* was designed to help developers create platform-independent AR web content (that mixes virtual elements with some view of the real world) that will eventually run fully-featured on other platforms as the necessary features for 3D AR on the web become available. 

Core ideas in Argon.

1.Views of Reality
2.Augmentation
3.etc.
