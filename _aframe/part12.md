If you want to extend the functionality of your application beyond what you can do with the Argon-aframe tags, then you need to write some javascript on your own. One way to do this is to add an eventListener, as discussed in Lesson 5. A second way is to make your own component (with the javascript code inside defining how the component will act). This method is provided by A-Frame, and you can see the documentation for it [here](http://aframe.io/docs). Please read the documentation for A-Frame components. Argon-aframe will work with components just as A-Frame itself does.
